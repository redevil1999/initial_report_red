Initially, the fatalities in India in 2000 will have to be uploaded.

```{r}

india_firsthalf <- read.csv('india_1989_2001.csv')

india_secondhalf <- read.csv('india_2002_2015.csv')

```

The aim of this report was to calculate the total amount of fatalities in India in 2000. Therefore, sum adds up all the integers in the file.
```{r}

india_firsthalf_type <- india_firsthalf %>%
  group_by(type_of_violence)

india_secondhalf_type <- india_secondhalf %>%
  group_by(type_of_violence)

```

```{r}

ggplot(data = total_fatalities) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = 'India', y = total_fatalities))+
      ggtitle('Total number of fatalities in India in 2000')
