```

Initially, the fatalities in India in 2000 will have to be uploaded.

```{r}

fatalities_data <- read.csv('india_fatalities.csv')

```

The aim of this report was to calculate the total amount of fatalities in India in 2000. Therefore, sum adds up all the integers in the file.
```{r}

total_fatalities <- fatalities_data %>%
  summarise(total = sum(fatalities))

```

```{r}

ggplot(data = total_fatalities) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = 'India', y = total_fatalities))+
      ggtitle('Total number of fatalities in India in 2000')

```
